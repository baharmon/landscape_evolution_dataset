# Landscape evolution dataset
A sample dataset for the
[r.evolution](https://github.com/baharmon/landscape_evolution)
landscape evolution model.
This dataset includes
the [GRASS GIS](grass.osgeo.org) location **nc_spm_evolution**.
This location is in the North Carolina State Plane HARN Meters
coordinate system (EPSG code 3358).
It contains the mapset **PERMANENT**
with spatial data for Fort Bragg, NC.
The location also contains
rainfall records,
rules for custom color tables,
rules for recoding data,
and metadata.

The mapset includes:
1. a 10-meter resolution digital elevation model for 2012 for Fort Bragg
2. a time series of 1-meter resolution digital elevation models for 2004, 2014, and 2016
for near a highly eroded watershed near Patterson Branch Creek on Fort Bragg
3. 1-meter resolution orthoimagery for 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2014 for the watershed
4. derived data including shaded relief, landforms, and landcover
